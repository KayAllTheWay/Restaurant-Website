# Restaurant-Website

This is a restaurant website I made following a tutorial on Udemy, I decided to add my own code by making a second page and linking it to the index.html file. The second page named 'menu' displays food, I used Javascript to create a flip card effect. CSS not showing up in Github Pages I will work on solving the issue.

Update - Issue solved! I changed the name of the css file for some reason, so it didn't match the index.html stylesheet link. Changed the css file to name matching the one in the index file and now it works as it did before.
